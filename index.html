        <p> My name is Andrew Bowden. I graduated from Arizona State University in December 2017 with a degree in Business Marketing and Political Science. After realizing how important coding was to digital marketing, I decided to enroll in the UofA Coding bootcamp. I am very excited to be a web developer! </p>
        <p> Working on CSS has been driving me crazy! I absolutely love when things work though! </p>
        <p> I feel really good about how hard i've worked on this assignment. Considering I spent from 3pm till 11pm today on it. I wish I could have learned the viewports in class, because I can't seem to figure it out. Thankfully Bootstrap does the responsiveness for you, but my other assignment I struggled with.. </p>
        <p> I can probably write an entire page on the stuff I learned this week, even today. Functions are incredibly powerful, and are used to solve problems in Javascript. Arrays are lists of items that we use to solve problems. CSS is Cascading Style Sheets which is used to style HTML pages. </p>
        <p> HTML is Hypertext Markup Language and is used to do the barebones of a page. It is incredibly useful and does a lot on its own. Javascript actually creates life on the page and allows it to do advanced functions and triggers.</p>
